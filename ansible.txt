1.A step-by-step guide to deploying Ansible
Install Ansible on your server or computer. To do this, execute the command:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
2.Prepare an inventory.ini file where you specify your target hosts. Example:
[servers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
3.Create an Ansible playbook. For example, pingpong.yml:
---
- name: Ping hosts
  hosts: servers
  tasks:
    - name: Ping each host
      ping:
4.Save both files to your Git repository.
5.Run the Ansible playbook with the path to the inventory file:
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini pingpong.yml
6.Ansible will start the playbook and ping the hosts you specified.
